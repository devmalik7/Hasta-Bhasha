# Hasta-Bhasha(हस्त भाषा)
The project Hasta-Bhasha(हस्त भाषा) OR "Sign Detection Using AI/ML" aims to develop a system that utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to detect and interpret signs captured in images or video streams. This technology holds significant potential for various applications, particularly in accessibility, communication, and safety..
 This project was built on LSTM NN built on TF Keras.
